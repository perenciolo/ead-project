# EAD webapp project

# Repository contents

This repository contains the full application of the course Angular and Firebase - Build a Web Application, so this contains the complete application like it will look like at the end of the course. 

# Installation pre-requisites

For running this project we need and npm installed on our machine. These are some tutorials to install node in different operating systems: 

*Its important to install the latest version of Node*

- [Install Node and NPM on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imj8PgG3bZU)

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

# Installing the code

The code can be installed with the following command (needs to be run in the folder where package.json is):

    npm install 

If you prefer the Yarn package manager, instead of npm install you can also run:

    yarn

Although npm install would also work, its recommended to use Yarn to install the course dependencies. Yarn has the big advantage that if you use it you will be
installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, please post the complete error message in the Questions section of the course.    


## Running the code
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
